  - Time-Boxed:
    - 90 mins - 120 mins max
    - you can repeat it but ALWAYS start from the beginning
  - Coding pair (driver and navigator).
- Shift:

- speak loud and explain your decisions and code implementation

#### Navigator

- your are responsible for map and directions ... but please, do not touch the  keyboard üòÅ
- help driver with technologies (language, patterns and etc)
- bring new ideas

#### Audience

## TDD

- TDD (Test Driven Development) is a development technique where you first write the test (specification) before actually coding.
- Create test using Triple A pattern ( arrange, act, assert)

- Encourage code simplicity
- Increase code confidence and refactoring eligibility
